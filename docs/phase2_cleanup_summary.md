# Phase 2 Cleanup Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Consolidated Utility Functions

- Created a comprehensive `utils.ts` file with all common helper functions
- Added documentation to each utility function
- Moved the following functions from various files to `utils.ts`:
  - `createSearchEmbedding`: For generating vector embeddings with OpenAI
  - `serializeData`: For handling BigInt serialization
  - `truncateText`: For truncating text to specified length
  - `formatDate`: For consistent date formatting
  - `formatTimestamp`: For timestamp display
  - `formatDateRange`: For date range formatting

### 2. Standardized Vector Search Logic

- Refactored `src/app/api/stories/route.ts` to improve code organization
- Created separate functions for text search and vector search
- Implemented a consistent filtering mechanism for search results
- Added type-safety improvements
- Made the code more maintainable with clear function separation

### 3. Added Integration Tests

- Created basic integration tests for the stories API endpoint
- Set up Jest configuration for TypeScript testing
- Added test cases for query, publication filtering, and date range filtering
- Implemented proper mocking for Prisma and OpenAI dependencies

### 4. Created Data Flow Documentation

- Added `docs/data_flow.md` to document the flow from StoryDredge to HSA DB to UI
- Documented database schema and API contracts
- Outlined the import process and key components
- Added debugging and monitoring information

## Remaining Tasks

### 1. Remove Unused Components

- Several legacy components were identified but not yet removed to ensure system stability
- Components to be removed in the next phase:
  - Timeline references in ResultsDisplay.tsx
  - Debug flags in API routes

### 2. Jordi Improvements

- Not yet implemented, will be addressed after codebase cleanup is complete
- Will require extensions to generate documentary treatments
- Support for follow-up queries to be added

## Testing

- Added integration tests for API endpoints
- Verified that utility functions work correctly when imported from new location
- Ensured that code refactoring maintains all existing functionality

## Next Steps

1. Complete the removal of unused components
2. Begin work on Jordi improvements
3. Add more comprehensive test coverage
