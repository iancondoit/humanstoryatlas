# üß¨ Human Story Atlas (v2.1.0)

An interactive scientific exploration of narrative connections across human experience. Human Story Atlas is a powerful tool for discovering hidden narrative arcs and forgotten stories through a chat-driven interface.

## Purpose

Human Story Atlas is a generative archive exploration interface designed to uncover forgotten storylines and narrative connections in historical news data. It goes beyond traditional search by surfacing narrative potential, story arcs, and thematic connections that span across time and publications.

## About the Project

Human Story Atlas is built on the Universal Narrative Genome - a structured scientific decoding of story patterns across time, culture, and genre. It allows users to explore vast collections of stories and uncover hidden connections using natural language queries.

## üß† What Is the Human Story Atlas?

The Human Story Atlas is a narrative discovery engine built on top of digitized news archives. It does not return articles. It surfaces **story potential** ‚Äî arcs, themes, conflicts, and forgotten threads buried in historical data.

### Key Features

- Conversational interface (Jordi) that responds like a narrative researcher
- Real-time story clustering powered by the Universal Narrative Genome
- Thematic story labeling (e.g. "Cold War thriller", "forgotten HBO pilot")
- Emerging arc detection and synthesis from OCR-processed historical sources

This tool helps researchers, filmmakers, journalists, and creatives discover **compelling stories that history almost forgot**.

## üë§ Jordi ‚Äì Your Narrative Research Assistant

Jordi is your guide through the archive ‚Äî a conversational AI trained on thousands of articles, arcs, and hidden gems. She's not a search engine; she's a story whisperer who can:

* Find lost stories with dramatic potential
* Write documentary treatments and series concepts
* Uncover patterns and connections across decades
* Link people, places, and power structures into coherent narratives

Try prompts like:

* "Give me 5 stories that could become a true crime series."
* "Who appears in political scandals in Texas in the early 80s?"
* "Write a one-paragraph Netflix pitch for a story about a whistleblower."
* "Find a forgotten sports scandal with dramatic potential."

Every response is powered by the Universal Narrative Genome ‚Äî Jordi just knows how to read it.

## Key Features

### üí¨ Chat-Driven Interface with Jordi

* Ask natural language questions about stories, arcs, and narrative patterns
* Discover hidden connections and forgotten narratives
* Intelligent query processing that understands narrative context
* Conversational interface with an archivist's narrative voice

### üîç Smart Filtering

* Filter by publication source
* Set date ranges for temporal analysis
* Dynamically narrow search scope

### üß© Narrative Arc Discovery

* AI-powered story arc detection
* Visualization of related stories across time
* Thematic and structural pattern recognition
* Creative labeling of arc types (e.g., "Local Scandal with National Implications", "Gothic Mystery")

### üìä Universal Narrative Genome Stats

* Track story nodes indexed
* Monitor narrative arcs detected
* Map entities across the narrative space

## Technology Stack

* **Frontend**: Next.js 14, React, Tailwind CSS
* **Backend**: Next.js API routes with Prisma ORM
* **Database**: PostgreSQL with pgvector for vector storage
* **AI**: OpenAI for natural language understanding and vector embeddings

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18+)
* PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
* OpenAI API key
* Access to StoryDredge processed data (for importing stories)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/your-username/human-story-atlas.git  
cd human-story-atlas
2. Install dependencies:  
npm install
3. Set up environment variables:  
cp .env.example .env.local  
# Add your OpenAI API key and database connection details
4. Set up the database:  
npx prisma generate  
npx prisma migrate dev
5. Start the development server:  
npm run dev
6. Visit <http://localhost:3000> to start exploring the Human Story Atlas.

### Data Import from StoryDredge

The Human Story Atlas relies on processed story data from the StoryDredge project. To import data:

1. Ensure the StoryDredge data is available in the project's `StoryDredge/output/hsa-ready` directory
2. Run the import script: `npm run import:dredge`
3. Verify the import was successful: `npm run verify:dredge`

For detailed information about the data import process, see the [Data Import Documentation](docs/DATA_IMPORT.md).

## Usage

1. **Apply filters** to set your search context (publication, date range)
2. **Ask a question** in the prompt box or select an example prompt
3. **Explore results** showing discovered narrative arcs and key stories
4. **Follow suggested queries** to dive deeper into the narrative space

## Example Prompts

* "Show me 5 stories that could become a true crime series"
* "Find a forgotten sports scandal in 1977"
* "Uncover hidden arcs about women leaders in the 1970s"
* "Bring back political crises from the oil boom"
* "Write a one-paragraph Netflix pitch for a story about whistleblowers in the medical industry"
* "Who appears in both environmental stories and political scandals?"

## Data Pipeline

Human Story Atlas uses a data pipeline with the following components:

1. **StoryDredge**: Processes raw news articles through OCR and NLP to prepare them for narrative analysis
2. **Database**: Stores stories, entities, and arcs in a structured format with Prisma ORM
3. **Vector Storage**: (Future) Will enable semantic search and narrative pattern matching
4. **Jordi**: An AI guide that uses the processed data to generate narratives and insights
